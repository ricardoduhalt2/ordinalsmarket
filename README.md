# Ordinals Explorer NFT Integration

This project successfully integrates with the Ordinals Explorer API to fetch and display NFTs on the website.

## NFT Fetching Process

The NFTs are fetched from the Ordinals Explorer API and rendered on the `OrdinalsPage.tsx`. The `ordiscanApi.ts` utility file handles the API calls to retrieve the NFT data.

## Current Display

Currently, the NFTs are displayed as plain text and images. The next step is to enhance the visual presentation with modern and interactive styling.
